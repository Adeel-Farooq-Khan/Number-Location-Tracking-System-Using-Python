🌐 Explore the World with Phone Number Location Lookup! 🌍

Ever wondered where a phone number is from or which carrier it belongs to? I've created a Python project that can help you find out!

📱 Features:

Location Lookup: Enter any phone number, and it'll tell you the location (city, state, or country).
Carrier Information: Discover the service provider associated with the number.
Map Integration: See the location on an interactive map!

💡 How it Works:

Clone the repository.
Install the required Python packages.
Replace 'your_phone_number_here' and 'your_opencage_api_key_here' with the desired phone number and your OpenCage API key.
Run the script.
Voila! You'll get location and carrier info, plus a map visualization.
This project uses the phonenumbers library for phone number parsing and the OpenCage Geocoder for geolocation.

🚀 It's a fun and informative way to explore phone number data. Give it a try and let me know what you think!
